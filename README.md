# A* Path Finding Algorithm

This code implements the A* pathfinding algorithm using Pygame. It allows for interactive creation of barriers and visualization of the algorithm finding the shortest path between a start and end point on a grid.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- `pygame`
- `math`
- `queue`

## Usage

1. clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BilalSardar009/Shortest-Path-Finding-Game
   ```
2. Run the python script:
   ```bash
   python app.py 
   ```
## Example
1. Input Image:

## Controls

1. First, choose the start and end points by left-clicking on the cells
2. Left mouse button: Create barriers on the grid by clicking on cells.
3. Right mouse button: Remove barriers or clear start/end points by clicking on cells.
4. Spacebar: Execute the A* algorithm to find the shortest path between the start and end points.
5. 'c' key: Clear the grid and reset start/end points.
6. Feel free to modify the code according to your needs and integrate it into your projects.

This code is inspired by and adapted from the A* pathfinding tutorial by Tech With Tim. Check out the tutorial for a step-by-step explanation of the code and additional features.
